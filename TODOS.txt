x Implement tensor function
x Fix dot product amplitudes
x Verify we can reproduce a entanglement
- support example1
  - FORMGATE U HAD ID
  - APPLY U R

  - harder:
    - SELECT S1 R2 0 1 (0-1 is a range, S1 is where it's saved and R2 is the register)
    - MEASURE RES S1 (measure S1) (porbably hardest to support.)

- we will drop ADD for now because too complex.

- REPL stuff:
  - introspection of registers/gates
  - help command

[x] Implement tensor function
[x] Fix dot product amplitudes
[x] Verify we can reproduce a entanglement
- support example1
  - [x] FORMGATE U HAD ID
    - [x] need to form hashmap for storing variables
  - [ ] APPLY U R
  - [ ] harder:
    - [ ] SELECT S1 R2 0 1 (0-1 is a range, S1 is where it's saved and R2 is the register)
    - [ ] MEASURE RES S1 (measure S1) (porbably hardest to support.)
- [ ] REPL stuff:
  - [ ] introspection of registers/gates
  - [ ] help command
Notes;
- we will drop ADD for now because too complex.

* Prerequisites
- python2.7
- python-numpy
- python dev libs
- gcc
* Build
./src/compile.sh
* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bin/qasm
#+END_SRC
* Description
Currently this implements some quantum gates and quantum adder operations as found in research papers.
* Example input(HADAMARD -> CNOT)
#+BEGIN_SRC
INITIALIZE R 2 0
U TENSOR HAD ID
APPLY U R
APPLY CNOT R
PEEK R RES
#+END_SRC

* TODOS
- Rebuild in C
- Nice to have: Include quantum algorithms
- Rewrite simulator to be fully quantum circuit driven
